This is my very first web application written in PHP.
The things I was trying to accomplish here were the following:
- write a simple PHP app that works :)
- based on procedural PHP programming
- design & create a MySQL database
- code the interactions of PHP with MySQL - use forms to insert data into the database & querries to retrieve it & present it back in the site
- work with sessions, password hashing, managing the registration & login process
